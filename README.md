# scRNAseq

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package contains the `scRNAseq` dataset. It accompanies a
workshop-style class that provides an introduction to the emerging field
of Data Science in R, including data analysis and visualization, with a
particular focus on its utility for biological insight.

## Installation

You **cannot** yet install the released version of scRNAseq from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org).

So in the meantime, use the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("devangthakkar/scRNAseq")
```

## Example

This is how to take a `glimpse` into the genes dataset:

``` r
library(scRNAseq)
glimpse(scRNAseq)
```
